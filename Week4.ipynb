    "### Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "We have been using functions already but we never really went in depth on what they are. A function is really just a way to do some computation and receive a result from that computation. To do this the function needs an input that we provide to it. So the three parts of any function is input, computation, and output. Take for example the `open()` function. We pass it a path to a file and it returns us an opened file. We don't get to see the computation since it is hidden and we don't ask for a print output. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python comes with many predefined functions. However, sometimes we need to create our own functions so that we can easily reuse code.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a user-defined function we start by defining the function name and input what it takes using `def`. Then we put our code after the defining line. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note the colon and new line. The contents of the function are always indented below the colon. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also optionally include a statement outlining what the function does. This is like a comment, except it has a slightly different format. Note the 3 quotation marks and that the text appears in a different colour. This is an instruction to python to store that information as special information. You can then retrieve that information with a `help(function_name)` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want our function to return some answer or result then we need to include a `return` commmand at the end of our function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next code block I will create a function for computing lexical diversity. To review how functions work here is a good tutorial: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp"

    "## Regular expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "You often get data that needs a bit of extra cleaning. Regular expressions are a simple yet powerful way to do that. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we already imported the `re` module, above. Now we get to use one of its functions, `search()`. As with all functions that come from a module in python, you use it by typing the name of the module before the function: `re.search()`. \n",
    "\n",
    "`re.search()` takes two arguments: \n",
    "1. the pattern you are searching for\n",
    "2. the place where you are searching for it (usually a string)\n",
    "\n",
    "`re.search('e', 'beekeeper)` finds the first instance of the letter 'e' in the word 'beekeeper'. Try it below. \n",
    "\n",
    "But, if you want to find not just the first, but all of the instances, then you use `re.findall()`. Try it below as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you can use `re.sub()` to replace text that matches a certain pattern. `re.sub()` takes 3 arguments: the pattern, the thing to replace it with, and the string. Try it below to replace 'the' with 'a'.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few useful conventions in regular expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `[]` matches one of the things inside\n",
    "    * `[Tt]` matches either upper or lower case 't'   \n",
    "* `[-]` matches a range\n",
    "    * `[0-9]` matches a single instance of all the numbers from 0 to 9\n",
    "    * `[a-z]` matches all lowercase letters\n",
    "    * `[A-Z]` matches all uppercase letters\n",
    "*  `[*]` matches 0 or more of the previous characters\n",
    "    * `[o*h!]` matches: `h!, oh!, ooh!, oooh!, ooooh!`, etc\n",
    "*  `[+]` matches 1 or more of the previous characters\n",
    "    * `[o+h!]` matches: `oh!, ooh!, oooh!, ooooh!`, etc\n",
    "* `[.]` ignores the previous character\n",
    "    * `[.]` matches: `begin, began, begun`, but also `begon` and `beg3n`. This is useful to identify patterns such as `sh!t`.\n",
    "* Special characters, such as `.`, `,`, or `\\`, need to be preceded by a backslash, so that the regular expression knows that you mean literally the actual punctuation mark, not its use as a regular expression convention.\n",
    "    * `[\\.]` means \"find the first instance of a period\"\n",
    "* `[^]` matches the beginning of the line; `[$]` matches the end of the line"
